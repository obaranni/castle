# Castle
The castle is the level at which you have to seize the fortress and take the throne of the king. Note: The castle is guarded by a night watch.
 Things that might help:
- Look into Solidity's documentation on the delegatecall low level function, how it works, how it can be used to delegate operations to on-chain. libraries, and what implications it has on execution scope.
- Understanding what it means for delegatecall to be context-preserving.
- Understanding how storage variables are stored and accessed.
- Understanding how casting works between different data types.
